## How to build packages based on mocaccino-micro

There are three ways to build packages:
- Use luet and clone this tree. Specify as an additional tree where you store your specfiles, and point the `luet build` command to both trees (with multiple ```--tree```)
- Add a submodule to your spectree pointing to this repository
- Base your specfile from mocaccino-micro docker images.
